  <p>The Service Provider may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process</li>
    <li>When they believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect their rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request</li>
